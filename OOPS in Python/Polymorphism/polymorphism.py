Polymorphism means having many forms 
two types of polymorphism
1. Run tume (dynamic binding, late binding)      => Function overriding
2. Compile Time (static binding, early binding)  => Function overloading

Hash attributes
Types of Overloading
1. Function overloading
2. Operator overloading 
3. Method overloading (not supported in python)
4. Constructor overloading (not supported in python)

Python only supports operator overloading
It does not support constructor overloading and method overloading

In case of method overloading, if multiple methods having the same name are present, 
pyhton always considers the last method, hence method overloading is not possible in python

Same is the issue with constructor overloading


Types of overriding
1. Method overriding 
2. Constructor overriding
